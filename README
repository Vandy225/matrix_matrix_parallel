======================
Instructions To Make
======================


Just type "make" in the source directory. This will produce 3 binaries:

serial
threading
cuda

You can run each separately with the appropriate command line arguments (run <command> -h for usage) to test the program.
There are also wrapper scripts to test each condition of the program across problem size in the folders "runners_*". If you
run these scripts, they will perform all relevant tests as indicated by their file name.

==============
Project Report
==============

The report is in the source directory and is named "Project Report.odt". I would recommend using Libreoffice to view it.

===========
Data
===========

Raw excel-like data is in the file "4210 Spreadsheet.ods". This contains all of the data obtained from my experiments if you want to 
view it.

============================
Many-core/multicore writeup
============================

This is located in the source directory and is named "many_core_remarks.txt". This is to address the final requirement of the project.

========================
